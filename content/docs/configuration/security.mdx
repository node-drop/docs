# Security

Secure your NodeDrop installation with these best practices.

## Authentication

### JWT Secret

Always use a strong, random JWT secret:

```bash
# Generate a secure secret
openssl rand -base64 64
```

Never use default or weak secrets in production.

### Password Requirements

NodeDrop enforces:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Mix of letters and numbers recommended

## Network Security

### HTTPS

Always use HTTPS in production:

1. Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy)
2. Obtain SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
3. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### Firewall

Only expose necessary ports:
- **5678** - NodeDrop application
- Block direct database/Redis access from internet

### Reverse Proxy Example (nginx)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name nodedrop.example.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5678;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```


## Database Security

### Credentials

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Don't use default credentials
- Rotate passwords periodically

### Access Control

- Limit database access to NodeDrop only
- Use separate database users per environment
- Enable SSL for database connections

### Backups

- Regular automated backups
- Test restore procedures
- Encrypt backup files

## Credential Encryption

NodeDrop encrypts stored credentials:
- AES-256 encryption
- Encryption key derived from JWT_SECRET
- Credentials decrypted only during execution

## Webhook Security

### Authentication

Enable authentication on webhooks:
- Basic Auth
- Header-based tokens
- HMAC signatures

### Validation

- Validate incoming data
- Check content types
- Implement rate limiting

## Rate Limiting

NodeDrop includes rate limiting for:
- Authentication endpoints
- API requests
- Webhook endpoints

Configure limits based on your needs.

## Audit Logging

Track security-relevant events:
- Login attempts
- Credential access
- Workflow executions

Available in Cloud edition with enhanced audit logs.
