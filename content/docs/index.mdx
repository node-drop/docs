## Features

### Workflow Automation
Build complex automations by connecting nodes together. Each node performs a specific action - from making HTTP requests to transforming data to integrating with AI services.

### Multiple Trigger Types
Start workflows in different ways:
- **Manual** - Run on demand
- **Schedule** - Cron-based scheduling
- **Webhook** - HTTP endpoints that trigger workflows
- **Events** - React to changes in connected services

### Built-in Nodes
NodeDrop comes with 25+ built-in nodes covering:
- HTTP requests and webhooks
- Data transformation (Set, JSON, Code)
- Logic and flow control (If/Else, Switch, Loop)
- AI integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- And more...

### Secure Credential Management
