# Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow that demonstrates the core concepts of NodeDrop.

## What We'll Build

A workflow that:
1. Triggers manually
2. Makes an HTTP request to fetch data
3. Transforms the response
4. Outputs the result

## Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Log in to NodeDrop
2. Click **New Workflow** in the sidebar
3. Give your workflow a name like "My First Workflow"

## Step 2: Add a Manual Trigger

Every workflow needs a trigger - the event that starts the automation.

1. Click the **+** button on the canvas
2. Search for "Manual Trigger"
3. Click to add it to your workflow

The Manual Trigger lets you run the workflow on demand by clicking the "Execute" button.

## Step 3: Add an HTTP Request Node

Now let's fetch some data from an API.

1. Click the **+** button that appears after the trigger
2. Search for "HTTP Request"
3. Configure the node:
   - **Method**: GET
   - **URL**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`

This will fetch a sample post from a test API.

## Step 4: Add a Set Node

Let's transform the data to extract just what we need.

1. Add a **Set** node after the HTTP Request
2. Configure it to set a new field:
   - **Field Name**: `summary`
   - **Value**: Use the expression picker to select `{{ $json.title }}`

## Step 5: Execute the Workflow

1. Click the **Execute Workflow** button in the toolbar
2. Watch as each node executes in sequence
3. Click on any node to see its output data

## Understanding the Results

After execution, you'll see:
- Green checkmarks on successfully executed nodes
- The output data panel showing what each node produced
- Execution history in the sidebar

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first workflow, try:

- Adding an **If/Else** node to add conditional logic
- Using a **Schedule Trigger** to run automatically
- Creating a **Webhook Trigger** to accept external requests

## Tips

- **Save often** - Use Ctrl/Cmd + S to save your workflow
- **Test incrementally** - Execute after adding each node to verify it works
- **Check the output** - Click nodes to inspect their data
- **Use expressions** - Reference data from previous nodes with `{{ $json.fieldName }}`
