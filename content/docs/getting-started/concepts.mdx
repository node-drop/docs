# Core Concepts

Understanding these concepts will help you build effective workflows in NodeDrop.

## Workflows

A **workflow** is a collection of connected nodes that automate a process. Workflows:
- Start with a trigger node
- Process data through action nodes
- Can branch, loop, and merge data flows

## Nodes

**Nodes** are the building blocks of workflows. Each node performs a specific action:

### Trigger Nodes
Start workflow execution. Every workflow needs at least one trigger.

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Manual Trigger | Run on demand |
| Schedule Trigger | Run on a cron schedule |
| Webhook Trigger | Run when HTTP request received |
| Workflow Trigger | Run from another workflow |
| Error Trigger | Run when another workflow fails |

### Action Nodes
Process and transform data.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| HTTP | HTTP Request |
| Transform | Set, JSON, Code |
| Logic | If/Else, Switch, Loop, Split, Merge |
| AI | OpenAI, Anthropic, Chat |
| Utility | Wait, Data Preview |

## Connections

**Connections** link nodes together, defining the flow of data. Data flows from output ports to input ports.

- Most nodes have one input and one output
- Logic nodes (If/Else, Switch) have multiple outputs
- Merge nodes have multiple inputs

## Data Flow

Data in NodeDrop flows as **items** - JSON objects that pass between nodes.

```json
{
  "json": {
    "name": "John",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

Each node receives items from the previous node, processes them, and outputs new items.

## Expressions

**Expressions** let you reference data from previous nodes using the `{{ }}` syntax:

```
{{ $json.fieldName }}           // Current item's field
{{ $node["NodeName"].json.field }}  // Specific node's output
{{ $input.first().json.field }}     // First input item
```

## Credentials

**Credentials** securely store authentication data like API keys and OAuth tokens. They're:
- Encrypted at rest
- Reusable across workflows
- Managed separately from workflow definitions

## Executions

An **execution** is a single run of a workflow. NodeDrop tracks:
- Execution status (success, error, running)
- Data at each node
- Timing information
- Error messages

## Environments

**Environments** let you use different configurations (like API endpoints) for development vs production without changing your workflow.

## Workspaces (Cloud Edition)

**Workspaces** organize workflows, credentials, and team members. Available in the Cloud edition for team collaboration.
