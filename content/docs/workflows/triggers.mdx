# Triggers

Triggers determine when and how your workflow starts executing. Every workflow needs at least one trigger.

## Manual Trigger

The simplest trigger - runs when you click the Execute button.

**Use cases:**
- Testing and development
- On-demand tasks
- Workflows you run occasionally

**Configuration:** None required

## Schedule Trigger

Runs workflows on a schedule using cron expressions.

**Use cases:**
- Daily reports
- Periodic data syncs
- Scheduled cleanups

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Cron Expression | When to run | `0 9 * * *` (9 AM daily) |
| Timezone | Timezone for schedule | `America/New_York` |

### Common Cron Patterns

```
* * * * *     Every minute
0 * * * *     Every hour
0 9 * * *     Daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * 1     Every Monday at 9 AM
0 0 1 * *     First day of month
```

## Webhook Trigger

Creates an HTTP endpoint that triggers the workflow when called.

**Use cases:**
- Receiving data from external services
- API integrations
- Real-time event handling

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| HTTP Method | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| Path | Custom URL path (optional) |
| Authentication | None, Basic Auth, Header Auth |
| Response Mode | Immediate or wait for workflow |

### Webhook URL

After saving, you'll get a unique webhook URL:
```
https://your-instance.com/webhook/abc123
```

### Receiving Data

Data sent to the webhook is available in the node output:
- `$json.body` - Request body
- `$json.headers` - Request headers
- `$json.query` - Query parameters

### Example: Receiving JSON

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-instance.com/webhook/abc123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}'
```

Access in workflow:
```
{{ $json.body.name }}  // "John"
{{ $json.body.email }} // "john@example.com"
```

## Workflow Trigger

Allows one workflow to call another, enabling modular workflow design.

**Use cases:**
- Reusable sub-workflows
- Breaking complex workflows into parts
- Shared logic across workflows

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Workflow | Select the workflow to call |
| Input Data | Data to pass to the sub-workflow |

### Calling a Sub-Workflow

Use the **Execute Workflow** node to call a workflow with a Workflow Trigger.

## Error Trigger

Runs when another workflow fails, enabling error handling and notifications.

**Use cases:**
- Error notifications (Slack, email)
- Retry logic
- Error logging

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Workflow | Which workflow's errors to catch |
| Error Types | All errors or specific types |

### Error Data

The trigger provides error details:
- `$json.error.message` - Error message
- `$json.error.workflow` - Failed workflow name
- `$json.error.node` - Node that failed
- `$json.error.timestamp` - When it failed

## Google Sheets Trigger

Runs when a Google Sheet is modified.

**Use cases:**
- Form submissions
- Spreadsheet-based workflows
- Data entry automation

**Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Spreadsheet | Google Sheet to monitor |
| Sheet | Specific sheet/tab |
| Trigger On | Row added, updated, or deleted |

**Requires:** Google OAuth credentials

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Trigger

| Scenario | Recommended Trigger |
|----------|-------------------|
| Testing | Manual |
| Periodic tasks | Schedule |
| External integrations | Webhook |
| Modular workflows | Workflow |
| Error handling | Error |

### Webhook Security

- Use authentication when possible
- Validate incoming data
- Consider rate limiting for public webhooks
- Use HTTPS in production

### Schedule Considerations

- Account for timezone differences
- Avoid scheduling too frequently
- Consider execution time when setting intervals
