# OAuth Setup

OAuth allows NodeDrop to access external services on your behalf without storing your password.

## How OAuth Works

1. You authorize NodeDrop to access a service
2. The service provides an access token
3. NodeDrop uses the token for API requests
4. Tokens are automatically refreshed

## Setting Up OAuth Credentials

### Google (Gmail, Sheets, etc.)

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable the APIs you need (Gmail, Sheets, etc.)
4. Go to **Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**
5. Select **Web Application**
6. Add authorized redirect URI:
   ```
   https://your-nodedrop-url/oauth/callback/google
   ```
7. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
8. In NodeDrop, create a Google OAuth credential with these values

### GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **New OAuth App**
3. Set Authorization callback URL:
   ```
   https://your-nodedrop-url/oauth/callback/github
   ```
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
5. Create credential in NodeDrop


### Generic OAuth2

For services not specifically supported:

1. Find the service's OAuth documentation
2. Create an OAuth app in their developer portal
3. Note the authorization and token URLs
4. In NodeDrop, create a Generic OAuth2 credential:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Client ID | From the service |
| Client Secret | From the service |
| Authorization URL | Service's auth endpoint |
| Token URL | Service's token endpoint |
| Scopes | Required permissions |

## Authorizing Credentials

After creating an OAuth credential:

1. Click **Connect** or **Authorize**
2. You'll be redirected to the service
3. Log in and grant permissions
4. You're redirected back to NodeDrop
5. The credential is now active

## Token Refresh

OAuth tokens expire. NodeDrop automatically:
- Detects expired tokens
- Uses refresh tokens to get new access tokens
- Retries failed requests with new tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Authorization Failed

- Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check redirect URI matches exactly
- Ensure required APIs are enabled

### Token Expired

- Re-authorize the credential
- Check if refresh token was revoked
- Verify scopes haven't changed

### Permission Denied

- Review requested scopes
- Check service-side permissions
- Ensure account has access to resources

## Security Notes

- OAuth tokens are encrypted like other credentials
- Refresh tokens allow long-term access
- Revoking access in the service invalidates tokens
- Use minimum required scopes
