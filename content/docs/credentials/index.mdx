# Credentials

Credentials securely store authentication data like API keys, OAuth tokens, and passwords.

## Why Use Credentials?

- **Security** - Encrypted at rest, never exposed in workflows
- **Reusability** - Use the same credentials across multiple workflows
- **Management** - Update once, applies everywhere
- **Separation** - Keep secrets separate from workflow logic

## Creating Credentials

1. Go to **Settings > Credentials**
2. Click **New Credential**
3. Select the credential type
4. Enter your authentication details
5. Click **Save**

## Credential Types

### API Key

Simple key-based authentication.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Credential name |
| API Key | Your API key |

### Basic Auth

Username and password authentication.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Username | Account username |
| Password | Account password |

### Bearer Token

Token-based authentication.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Token | Bearer token value |


### OAuth2

OAuth-based authentication for services like Google, GitHub, etc.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Client ID | OAuth client ID |
| Client Secret | OAuth client secret |
| Scopes | Permissions requested |

See [OAuth Setup](/docs/credentials/oauth) for detailed instructions.

## Using Credentials in Nodes

1. Add a node that requires authentication
2. In the node properties, find the Credentials field
3. Select an existing credential or create new
4. The node uses the credential automatically

## Managing Credentials

### Editing

1. Go to **Settings > Credentials**
2. Click on the credential
3. Update the values
4. Save changes

### Deleting

1. Go to **Settings > Credentials**
2. Click the delete icon
3. Confirm deletion

**Note:** Deleting credentials may break workflows using them.

### Testing

Some credential types have a Test button to verify they work.

## Security Best Practices

### Access Control
- Only create credentials you need
- Use separate credentials for dev/prod
- Regularly rotate API keys

### Credential Scope
- Use minimum required permissions
- Create service-specific credentials
- Don't share credentials across unrelated workflows

### Monitoring
- Review credential usage periodically
- Remove unused credentials
- Monitor for unauthorized access

## Credential Storage

Credentials are:
- Encrypted using AES-256
- Stored in the database
- Never logged or exposed in UI
- Decrypted only during execution
